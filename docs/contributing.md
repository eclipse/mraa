Contributing to libmraa                           {#contributing} 
======================

libmraa is an opensource project and we are actively looking for people to help
with:

- Writing platform supports for all types of embedded boards running linux
- People to write cool samples
- People to extend the functionality

The recommended method to contribute is to fork on github, and then send pull
requests to the main project. Questions can be also be asked and issues raised
on github.

If you'd rather not use github you are more than welcome to send git formatted
patches to brendan.le.foll@intel.com.

Basic rules
-----------
- Your code must build
- Commits must have a sign-off line by at least yourself
- Commits must be named <file/module>: Some decent description
- Try not to break master. In any commit.
- Try to split commits up logically, you will be asked to rebase them if they
  are not.
- Try to stick to the established coding style regardless of your personal feeling for it!

Code signing
------------

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it
on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below:

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then you just add a line saying

	Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
