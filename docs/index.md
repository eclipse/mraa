libmraa - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
==============

Libmraa is a C/C++ library with bindings to Python, Javascript and Java to
interface with the I/O on Galileo, Edison & other platforms, with a structured
and sane API where port names/numbering matches the board that you are on. Use
of libmraa does not tie you to specific hardware with board detection done at
runtime you can create portable code that will work across the supported
platforms.

The intent is to make it easier for developers and sensor manufacturers to map
their sensors & actuators on top of supported hardware and to allow control of
low level communication protocol by high level languages & constructs.

## API

These interfaces allow you to interact with all libmraa functionality. The C++
classes directly wrap the C API and provide a near 1:1 mapping of
functionality.
