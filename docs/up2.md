UP Squared  Board   {#up2}
================================
UP Squared is based on the Intel&reg; Celeron&trade; N3350 or the Intel&reg; Pentium&trade; N4200, formerly Skylake&trade;.

For the full specification please refer to the main specification page here:

Interface notes
-----------------------
The Up Squared present one Raspberry Pi compatible HAT connector and a  60 pin exHAT connector. Currently this implementation only support the interfaces through the HAT connector.

**I2C**
 - 2 channels
 - support: standard-mode (100kHz), fast-mode (400kHz) , Fast-mode plus (1MHz), High-speed mode (3.4MHz)
 - bus frequency can be selected in BIOS settings.
 - the default i2c channel is the one connected to the pin 3,5 of the hat

**SPI**
- Bus frequencies up to 10MHz are supported.
- 3 chip-selects.

**PWM**
 - up to 3 channel of PWM

**UART**
- 1 high-speed UART is available
- supporting baud rates up to 3686400 baud.
- Hardware flow-control signals are available on pins 11/36 (RTS/CTS).

Please note that a kernel with UP board support is required to enable the I/O
interfaces above.

Pin Mapping
--------------------
The GPIO numbering in the following pin mapping is based on the Raspberry Pi
model 2 and B+ numbering scheme.

NOTE: the i2c device numbering depend on various factor and cannot be trusted:
the right way of determining i2c (and other devices) numbering is through PCI
physical device names. See the source code in src/x86/up2.c for details.
