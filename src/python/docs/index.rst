Compiling & Debugging libmraa
=============================

Libmraa is a C library and SWIG is used to generate bindings therefore to
debug, you very quickly need to use the same methods as you would for debugging
a C library. Generally attaching gdb to python works well, build mraa with
debug symbols and set breakpoints either in the SWIG _wrap functions, the C++
method/functions or the underlying C function. More info can be found on the
C/C++ documentation:
   * `Debugging <../debugging.html>`_
   * `Building from source <../building.html>`_
