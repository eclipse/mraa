MRAA TEST CASES:

This is the first set of test cases for libmraa. Curently each component of mraa is
tested in it's separated designed file (*_test.py + general_checks.py). In order to
run these tests simply type the name of the script (eg.: ./GPIO_test.py script's path)
For a verbose run, just add the -v flag (eg. ./GPIO_test.py -v). 
The tests set created is intended for easy and quick sanity checks. They are intended 
to give an idea of the functionality available on the board.


WHERE WERE THESE TESTS RAN:

As main platform, Intel Galileo v1 was used. Tests were conducted on Intel Galileo v2,
but because of hardware differences, some failures may occur. Logic will be added to 
auto-select board to work on.

KNOWN ISSUES:

Since libmraa is a library addressed for boards communication with outside world, for 
specific components like I2C, SPI some sensors were used (I2C ---> HTU21 and SPI ---> TMP125).
As of this some tests may not be relevant unless those sensors are available. Also, some 
small mistakes may be present.

WHAT'S NEXT? 

At this point tests were made to do a quick sanity check. For the future the followings will
be implemented:
 - create a physical layer that will emulate sensors behavior and generate I/O signals. This
   layer will be available to the community and will help replace the need of specific sensors.
   The simplest solution will be chosen allowing anyone to rapidly implement it. 
 - Implement stress tests over long periods of time. This feature alone is possible only with
   the use of a physical layer since it will behave both as signals generator and interpreter.
 - analyze a tests result collection solution (and after, interpretation). This is useful
   since tests mean nothing without a history and possibility to check on results.
 - any new idea is welcomed.
