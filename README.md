MRAA - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
==============

Library in C/C++ to interface with Galileo & other Intel platforms, in a
structured and sane API with port names/numbering that match boards & with
bindings to javascript & python.

The intent is to make it easier for developers and sensor manufacturers to map
their sensors & actuators on top of supported hardware and to allow control of
low level communication protocol by high level languages & constructs.
